## Hi there 🤘🏻 🤘🏼 🤘🏽 🤘🏾 🤘🏿

### ⚓ Welcome to my GitHub pages.  

I'm a geographer 🌐 turned information manager 📈 turned epidemiologist 🦠 turned data scientist in #agrotech 🧑‍🌾🌱🚜. 

I'm currently working as a senior data scientist at [@syngenta](https://github.com/syngenta) where I focus on computational reproducibility of research, mainly using #Rstats. Majority of my development moved to closed source projects on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Radoslaw.Panczak).   

This space works mostly as an archive of my previous academic work at the University of Bern 🇨🇭 and The University of Queensland 🇦🇺 and will be (infrequently 😴) updated with contributions to few projects.     

### 📜 Some of my completed projects include:
- looking at association of voting patterns and excess mortality in Switzerland [here](https://github.com/RPanczak/ISPM_excess-mortality-voting)  
- update & re-validation of second release of the Swiss-SEP index [here](https://github.com/RPanczak/SNC_Swiss-SEP2)  
- leading implementation of version control and open data within [@IeDEA-SA](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA) [here](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA/IeDEA_WG-open-science)
- investigating influence of socioeconomic position on the COVID-19 testing, hospitalisation and mortality [here](https://github.com/jriou/covid-sep-ch)  
- tracking century of excess mortality in Switzerland 🇨🇭, Sweden 🇸🇪 & Spain 🇪🇸 [here](https://github.com/RPanczak/ISPM_excess-mortality-historical)  
- working as reproduction analyst for [@CenterForOpenScience](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience) [SCORE project](https://www.cos.io/score) with three analyses
    - [Siedner *et al.* (2020)](https://github.com/RPanczak/SCORE_Siedner_covid_P3NJ)
    - [Fielding-Miller *et al.* (2020)](https://github.com/RPanczak/SCORE_Fielding-Miller_covid_R3pV) 
    - [Kim & Radoias (2016)](https://github.com/RPanczak/SCORE_Kim_SocSciMed_2016_AqDO)    
- searching for Techniques for Estimating MObile Populations in 🇦🇺 using: 
    - Wi-Fi, Google Places and trasportation data on [campus](https://github.com/RPanczak/TEMPO_pop247) 
    - scrapped road traffic data in the [city](https://github.com/RPanczak/TEMPO_BCC-traffic)
    - Airbnb usage in the [country](https://github.com/RPanczak/TEMPO_Airbnb)

### 🎡 Some of my fun side projects include:  
- analysing dog permits in Brisbane 🇦🇺 to derive indicators of socioeconomic position [here](https://github.com/RPanczak/FUN_BCC-animal-permits)  
- analysing publically available Swisscom 🇨🇭 Mobility Insights [here](https://github.com/RPanczak/FUN_swisscom)  

### 🧐 I'm learning more about:  
- machine learning in R 
    - ✔️ with book [Machine Learning with R](https://github.com/RPanczak/R_MLwR) 
    - ✔️ with book [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://github.com/RPanczak/R_ISLR)
- design and analysis of experiments in R 
    - 🚧 with book [Statistics for Experimenters](https://github.com/RPanczak/R_SfE)
    - 🚧 with book [Design and Analysis of Experiments with R](https://github.com/RPanczak/R_DaAoEiR)
